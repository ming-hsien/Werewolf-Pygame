# Werewolf-Pygame
Werewolf, also known as "The Werewolves of Millers Hollow," is a popular social deduction party game that tests players' ability to strategize, bluff, and work together. Set in a village plagued by werewolves, players are assigned secret roles, such as villagers, werewolves, or special characters like the seer or witch. The goal of the game varies depending on the player's role: the villagers aim to identify and eliminate the werewolves, while the werewolves work to outwit the villagers and eliminate them one by one. The game is filled with intense debates, strategic eliminations, and unexpected twists, making it an engaging experience for players of all ages.

## Description

However, playing Werewolf traditionally requires physical cards to assign roles randomly to players, which can sometimes be inconvenient or lead to issues like missing or damaged cards.

To solve this problem, I developed a card distribution automation program. This program assigns roles digitally, ensuring a fair, efficient, and hassle-free way to start the game. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned Werewolf enthusiast or a first-time player, this program simplifies the setup and lets you dive straight into the action!
